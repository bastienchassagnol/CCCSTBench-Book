overview\":[\"Computes scores for any gene pair between two cell types. In parallel builds a gene network per cell type using principal component regression.

Assuming that distributions of LR and RT are independent, joint significance is the multiplication of their individual significances.\",\"Builds a ligand-receptor and ECM-receptor database using GO terms to filter known PPI databases. CCIs are inferred based on LR interactions expressed in cell types. To investigate condition-associated perturbations, DGE metrics based on the tool MAST are used (e.g., logFC and P-value).\",\"Uses networks of ligand-receptor interactions connected to their TFs, and links the TFs with their target genes. CCCExplorer is based on differential expression of ligands and target genes (vs WT), while receptors and TFs are considered expressed if they are over a threshold.\",\"Identifies multi-subunit ligand-receptor interactions at the cell type level by computing expression products of all possible combinations between ligand subunits and receptor subunits. It calculates average expressions of ligand and receptor subunits across cell clusters, and removes the LR pair if any subunit is not expressed in these averages. It then shuffles the cluster annotations and recalculates average expressions.

It also includes TF activity on the final score.\",\"Connects two intracellular networks (from different cells) through known ligand-receptor interactions. It prioritizes LR pairs that are not used for autocrine interactions (low correlation within the same cluster) to assign a high crosstalk score. Then, it employs a network propagation based on the gene expression of intracellular genes. Finally it identifies signaling networks as a prize-collecting steiner forest problem to find intracellular genes that are close to highly-scored LR pairs.\",\"Uses a network of ligand-receptor-TF-targets, and considers only pathways whose ligands and receptors are expressed. This means that they are over a z-value when comparing all clusters or cell types. It connects receptors to TF using Pearson correlation. It excludes receptors that are downstream to a TF in the network.\",\"Binary presence of TFs by fraction of cells within a cluster.

It uses the cell-type-specific highly-expressed genes to infer CCIs. LR pairs are scored with their expression product. It uses Fisher's exact test to consider active TFs, by using information of expressed target genes. Then LR pairs and enriched TFs are connected with another Fisher's test, considering whether active TFs are enriched in a given receptor. Thus, only LR pairs passing these test are retained.\",\"Integrates multiple sources of information such as PPI networks and membrane-receptor regulatory networks. It relies on other tools to compute the receptor activity as a regulator of target genes. Finally, aggregates all the scores through a Robust Rank Aggregation method, generating a final rank of LR pairs.\",\"Uses a Personalized PageRank algorithm to identify important ligands having an effect on downstream target genes.

This activity is computed from a gene set enrichment analysis on the regulons of a transcriptional regulator.\",\"Integrates ligand-receptor-TF relationships as well as TF-Target Genes. It computes the interaction scores by weighing with the TF activity score. This TF activity comes from a gene set enrichment analysis using the coexpressed target genes of that TF (regulons).\",\"Incorporates gene expression of genes that are downstream to a receptor in a ligand-receptor interaction.

Subsamples single cells when the cell number is too high.\",\"Uses a multi-level graph autoencoder to infer CCIs. One graph considers cell-cell relationships to represent the proximity of cells and their potential to interact.

This preserves the comparability between distributions (total signal does not exceed the individual species amounts - ligand or receptor - , and enforces spatial range limits and handles multiple competing species.\",\"Uses spatial transcriptomics to weigh LR interactions based on intercellular distances. LR interactions are filtered out given a permutation analysis. This tool mainly focuses on the effect on target genes and tries to identify the important LR pairs contributing to those effects.\",\"Uses an adaptive graph model to infer CCIs.

Finally, it uses a cross-entropy approach to obtain low dimensional embeddings of CCIs.\",\"Uses a Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) approach to find latent topics of cells and genes. It applies a LDA to regular single-cell data and another to data coming from doublets (interacting cells). These two LDAs help to identify topics that are a consequence of the CCIs. Afterwards, topics are associated to cell types and genes, so specific molecular and cellular properties of CCIs can be interpreted.\",\"Uses graph convolutional neural networks to infer gene interactions involved in cell-cell communication from spatial single-cell expression data. GCNG encodes the spatial information as a graph and combines it with expression data to infer extracellular gene-gene interactions.\",\"Applies a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model using an expectation-maximization algorithm.

The distance matrix here is used as a cost matrix.\",\"Models the variance across cells of the gene expression level due to the additive effect of an intrinsic effect due to the cell state, a cell-cell interaction effect due to the state of the neighboring cells, and an environmental effect due to unobserved factors in the cell microenvironment. Thus, it can decompose the gene expression into these three effects and potentially identify CCIs given the spatial organization of cells.\",\"Uses a generalized linear regression model to infer CCIs from spatial transcriptomics.

This model infers the overall potential of CCIs.\",\"Evaluates the colocalization of cell types and their use of LR pairs in a spatial spot. By using a Fisher's exact test, identifies significant LR pairs in colocalized cell types within a spot.

Finally, it runs CellChat and evaluates CCIs only on those that were significant from Fisher's exact test.\",\"Uses a partial least square regression model to identify the CCI effects on multiple neighboring cell types. This model assumes that the expression of highly variable genes specific to a cell type are explained by a linear sum of the effects by neighboring cell types.\",\"Builds multiple views focusing on different spatial or functional contexts to dissect different effects.
