Hurdles for benchmarking cell-cell communication inference methods {#sec-hurdles-benchmark}\n\n#### Partial overlap between CCC databases\n\n\n\n#### Metric quantifying spatial gene expression distribution.\n\n- **Wasserstein distributions** to compare probability distributions:\n  - Represents the minimum total transport cost between two distributions.\n  - Use of Regularised versions, such as the **Sinkhorn algorithm**, for faster computation and reduces influence of extreme observations. \n  - Detailled theoretical explanations: [@rolet2016p1icais; @huizing2022; @solomon2017smmo; @peyre].\n  - **Consider truly spatial distributions and statistics** -> the **Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance** is a generalization of the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance that accounts for both **feature** (pointwise) and **structural similarities** (geometric) between two metric measure spaces. Enables to maintain the **graph structure**, as suggested in [@vayer2020a;titouan2019p3icml].\n\n#### Annotate cell-populations in spatial omics\n\nRecent deconvolution papers include: \n\n- STRIDE\n \n  \n  \nRelevant benchmark papers include: \n  \n  \n- [Systematic comparison of sequencing-based spatial transcriptomic methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02325-3), from @you2024nm.\n- [A comprehensive benchmarking with practical guidelines for cellular deconvolution of spatial transcriptomics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37168-7), from @li2023nc.\n- [Benchmarking spatial and single-cell transcriptomics integration methods for transcript distribution prediction and cell type deconvolution](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01480-9), from @li2022nm. Conclusions from the paper are reported in @imp-spatial-benchmark-deconvolution. \n\n::: {#imp-spatial-benchmark-deconvolution .callout-important title=\"Best spatial deconvolution algorithms\"}\n\nFrom @li2022nm, Tangram, gimVI, and SpaGE outperformed other integration methods for predicting the spatial distribution of RNA transcripts, whereas Cell2location, SpatialDWLS, and RCTD are the top-performing methods for the cell type deconvolution of spots.\n\n:::\n\n![Benchmark decision tree for Deconvolution Algorithms applied to Spatial Transcriptomics](images/benchmark_deconvolution.webp)\n\n##### Dynamic integration and mapping of cell populations\n\n- [`SIMO`, for  Spatial Integration of Multi-Omics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56523-4), from @yang2025nc. \n\n  - Probabilistic alignment relying on the fused **Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport** algorithm\n  - Integrates multiple single-cell modalities, such as chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation. \n  - Integrates co-localisation spatial patterns. \n\n  \n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Major hurdles when performing cell type annotation with a dynamic dimension\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\nMajor challenge is to track invidual cells's fate across time points, with both **experimental variability** (distinct technologies and experimental conditions across time points, image rotation and distortion, etc.) and **biological variability** (mutations in tumoral environment, cell differentiation in early-developmental stages, cell deaths, ...).\n\n:::\n\n\n#### Discriminate paracrine or juxtacrine with endocrine signalling (short vs long-range communications)\n\n1. Discriminate between short- and long-range cell-cell communications: \n- Current Use of $k$-means, to be replaced with: \n  - Use of mixture models to characterise and automatically retrive the threshold\n  - [`BanditPAM`](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vlevorato_machinelearning-datascience-unsupervised-activity-7289567831145279490-Ibchs) \n  - [Selection of the number of clusters](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vlevorato_datascience-machinelearning-unsupervised-activity-7292093235366121472-jMMg)\n  - Even better, review latest spatial methods tailored to spatial clustering.\n  \n2. Compare distances by:\n  i. Use of **Distance Enrichment Score** (compare the distribution of predicted short-rank and long-rank interactions with what's observed), similar to GSEA as showcased in [@subramanian2005pnas], and theretically largely inspired from the **Kolmogorov-Smirnov** statistical test. \n    - [General advises for enhanced comparision of statistical distributions](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adrianolszewski_statistics-datascience-activity-7256312446737387520-J8zk). Indeed, the KS only evaluates the maximal discrepancy between two distributions, and not the whole statistical distribution.  \n  ii. Confusion matrix between predicted **short-range** and **long-range** communications, benchmarked against the consensual setting.  \n  \n\n#### Simulate in-silico spatial transcriptomic distributions\n\n##### Single-cell simulations\n\n- [`Splatter`](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1305-0), from @zappia2017gb. \n  - A two-stage simulation process: \n      1.Estimation of the parameters from realistic datasets. \n      2.

In details, it first uses a **hull** algorithm to define the **outskirt** of the tissue in the shape of a polygon. Secondly, within the polygon, you can either define a square grid within the polygon with the number of points determined by the user, mimmicking the process underlying 10X Visium generation, OR uses a random point process to create locations within the polygon using the [`sp::spsample`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sp/versions/2.1-4/topics/spsample) R function^[Underlying principle: stratified random sampling, quite similar to survey sampling modelling], looking alike MERFISH or seqFISH+ SRT technologies.\n    2. **Stage 2**, generate cell-specific expression counts: Four statistical generative models are avalaible, namely P for Poisson, NB for negative binomial, ZIP for zero-inflated Poisson; ZINB for zero-inflated negative binomial, the latter 2 accouting for model **zero-inflation** (the so-called *drop-outs* issue common in scRNASeq datasets). All measures are used to infer the expression model for each of the 4 statistical count models implemented, one gene after the other (**strong assumption of gene independence and decorrelation with spatial location!!**).  The model finally selected is the one exhibiting the lowest AIC, whose parameters are subsequently used to generate synthetic expression counts. \n    3. **Step 3**: assign the simulated counts to the locations in the synthetic data preserving the spatial expression pattern observed in the reference data^[Idea: instead of using rank-order mapping, rely on a spatial version of **optimal transport** for perserving distribution shape -> minimise the Wasserstein distance between real and simulated spatial density distributions]. Specifically, `SRTsim` assigns the simulated expression counts to locations in the synthetic data preserving the rank derived from real data (for instance, the spatial location associated with the highest expression of a given gene in the real data will match the spatial location assigned to synthetic data).\n    4. **Optionnal**: Without prior knowledge, a reference-free simulation is also provided with the simulator, with the possibility of customising spatial patterns from a predefined shape of interest and generate synthetic data with user-specified model parameters.\n    5. **Optionnal 2**: possibility to extrapolate existing domain areas to uncovered spatial areas using an **affine transformation** which preserves most of the topological features. Report to @fig-SRTsim below for details. \n    \n- **Output**: a S4 object that contains:\n  - One matrix with the spatial tissue coordinates\n  - The corresponding simulated expression counts for all genes across all locations. \n  - The estimated model parameters, the user-defined parameter inputs and the input random seed.\n  \n![Overview of `SRTsim` from [@zhu2023gb, Fig 1](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-023-02879-z/figures/1). Inputs for the *reference-based* approach include a gene expression count matrix, a location matrix, and an optional domain annotation matrix to depict tissue distributions.](images/SRTsim.webp){#fig-SRTsim width=85%}\n\n#### Evaluation against ground truth estimates\n\n- Correlation between CCC predictions and spatial adjacency\n- Recovering the effect of receptor gene knockouts\n- Robustness to subsampling\n- Agreement with proteomics\n- scRNA-Seq simulated datasets \n- Ground truth among methods.\n\n\n### Computational platform and paper\n\n- R or Python\n- Nextflow or Snakemake (if you start from raw datasets, or requires combining distinct script languages paired with slurm intensive use.)\n- Package structure, including `./vignettes` folder, or simple call to Quarto or Jupyter Notebook documents. \n- Github or Gitlab repository, visibility? Contributions?\n- Choice of the Journal:\n  - Which review? Nature? Genome Biology?\n  - Which tool for writing the paper? Overleaf? Shared GitHub repo? Use of Nature quarto extensions (Pro: generate automatically both html and pdf versions)\n  - Which library repository (shared Zotero group has my favour)\n\n  \n## Outlooks\n\n### Statistical perspectives and methods\n\n- [Quantum computing](https://research.ibm.com/publications/a-perspective-on-quantum-computing-for-analyzing-cell-cell-communication-networks)\n\n### Biological perspectives\n\n### Infra and intra-cellular\n\n- Estimate bot extra- and intra- intracellular activities.\n\n#### Multi-scale perspective\n\n- [Niche differential gene expression analysis in spatial transcriptomics data identifies context-dependent cell-cell interactions](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.03.522646v1.full.pdf)\n\n- **Multi-scale**: Instead of considering a single-cell resolution consider a tissue resolution of the propagation signal \n  - `Visium`: spots often capture more than one cell\n  - `Xenium`: already at the single cell level. However, lacks of depth resolution.\n  \n  \n#### Cross-sample and cross-study\n\n- Cross-sample and cross-study comparisons, under different environmental conditions (identify the shared and differentiated pathways triggered from one condition to another)\n\n#### Dynamic cell-cell-communication inference\n\n#### Biological use cases\n\n- Wound healing\n- TME deconvolution and niche identification\n\n\n\n\n\n",
