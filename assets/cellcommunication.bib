  abstract = {Cell–cell interactions orchestrate organismal development, homeostasis and single-cell functions. When cells do not properly interact or improperly decode molecular messages, disease ensues. Thus, the identification and quantification of intercellular signalling pathways has become a common analysis performed across diverse disciplines. The expansion of protein–protein interaction databases and recent advances in RNA sequencing technologies have enabled routine analyses of intercellular signalling from gene expression measurements of bulk and single-cell data sets. In particular, ligand–receptor pairs can be used to infer intercellular communication from the coordinated expression of their cognate genes. In this Review, we highlight discoveries enabled by analyses of cell–cell interactions from transcriptomic data and review the methods and tools used in this context.},

Transcriptomics provides rich information to infer cell–cell interactions and communication, thus accelerating the discovery of the roles of cells within their communities. Such research relies heavily on algorithms that infer which cells are interacting and the ligands and receptors involved. Specific pressures on different research niches are driving the evolution of next-generation computational tools, enabling new conceptual opportunities and technological advances. More sophisticated algorithms now account for the heterogeneity and spatial organization of cells, multiple ligand types and intracellular signalling events, and enable the use of larger and more complex datasets, including single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. Similarly, new high-throughput experimental methods are increasing the number and resolution of interactions that can be analysed simultaneously. Here, we explore recent progress in cell–cell interaction research and highlight the diversification of the next generation of tools, which have yielded a rich ecosystem of tools for different applications and are enabling invaluable discoveries.},

Many computational tools were developed for this purpose. Each of them consists of a resource of intercellular interactions prior knowledge and a method to predict potential cell-cell communication events. Yet the impact of the choice of resource and method on the resulting predictions is largely unknown. To shed light on this, we systematically compare 16 cell-cell communication inference resources and 7 methods, plus the consensus between the methods’ predictions. Among the resources, we find few unique interactions, a varying degree of overlap, and an uneven coverage of specific pathways and tissue-enriched proteins. We then examine all possible combinations of methods and resources and show that both strongly influence the predicted intercellular interactions. Finally, we assess the agreement of cell-cell communication methods with spatial colocalisation, cytokine activities, and receptor protein abundance and find that predictions are generally coherent with those data modalities. To facilitate the use of the methods and resources described in this work, we provide LIANA, a LIgand-receptor ANalysis frAmework as an open-source interface to all the resources and methods.},

  abstract = {Defining meaningful distances between samples in a dataset is a fundamental problem in machine learning. Optimal Transport (OT) lifts a distance between features (the "ground metric") to a geometrically meaningful distance between samples. However, there is usually no straightforward choice of ground metric. Supervised ground metric learning approaches exist but require labeled data. In absence of labels, only ad-hoc ground metrics remain. Unsupervised ground metric learning is thus a fundamental problem to enable data-driven applications of OT. In this paper, we propose for the first time a canonical answer by simultaneously computing an OT distance between samples and between features of a dataset. These distance matrices emerge naturally as positive singular vectors of the function mapping ground metrics to OT distances. We provide criteria to ensure the existence and uniqueness of these singular vectors. We then introduce scalable computational methods to approximate them in high-dimensional settings, using stochastic approximation and entropic regularization. Finally, we showcase Wasserstein Singular Vectors on a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset.},

Addressing this need, researchers have developed integration methods to combine spatial transcriptomic data with single-cell RNA-seq data to predict the spatial distribution of undetected transcripts and/or perform cell type deconvolution of spots in histological sections. However, to date, no independent studies have comparatively analyzed these integration methods to benchmark their performance. Here we present benchmarking of 16 integration methods using 45 paired datasets (comprising both spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq data) and 32 simulated datasets. We found that Tangram, gimVI, and SpaGE outperformed other integration methods for predicting the spatial distribution of RNA transcripts, whereas Cell2location, SpatialDWLS, and RCTD are the top-performing methods for the cell type deconvolution of spots.

They delve into various formulations and techniques, starting with Monge’s formulation, illustrated through applications to one-dimensional optimal transport and distributions involving Gaussians. The notes then explore Kantorovich’s formulation, a more general approach that addresses limitations in Monge’s method and applies to a wider range of problems. Additionally, the course covers the concept of the Wasserstein distance, a key metric in optimal transport theory that quantifies the cost of transporting one distribution to another. The notes also introduce entropic regularization, an important technique used to smooth optimization problems and make them more tractable computationally. This approach facilitates the numerical solution of optimal transport problems by adding an entropy term to the objective function, leading to faster and more stable algorithms. Finally, the dual formulation of optimal transport problems is presented. This perspective allows for deriving alternative algorithms and insights into the structure of optimal transport solutions. By exploring the dual problem, students can understand the relationships between different formulations and how they can be exploited to solve transport problems more efficiently. Overall, these course notes provide a comprehensive introduction to the mathematics of computational optimal transport, offering insights into both theoretical foundations and practical applications.},

This problem can be tackled using non-negative matrix factorization approaches, using typically Euclidean or Kullback-Leibler fitting errors. Because these fitting errors are separable and treat each feature on equal footing, they are blind to any similarity the features may share. We assume in this work that we have prior knowledge on these features. To leverage this side-information, we propose to use the Wasserstein (\textbackslash textita.k.a. earth mover’s or optimal transport) distance as the fitting error between each original point and its reconstruction, and we propose scalable algorithms to to so. Our methods build upon Fenchel duality and entropic regularization of Wasserstein distances, which improves not only speed but also computational stability. We apply these techniques on face images and text documents. We show in particular that we can learn dictionaries (topics) for bag-of-word representations of texts using words that may not have appeared in the original texts, or even words that come from a different language than that used in the texts.},

  abstract = {Multicellular organisms are composed of diverse cell types that must coordinate their behaviors through communication. Cell–cell communication (CCC) is essential for growth, development, differentiation, tissue and organ formation, maintenance, and physiological regulation. Cells communicate through direct contact or at a distance using ligand–receptor interactions. So cellular communication encompasses two essential processes: cell signal conduction for generation and intercellular transmission of signals, and cell signal transduction for reception and procession of signals. Deciphering intercellular communication networks is critical for understanding cell differentiation, development, and metabolism. First, we comprehensively review the historical milestones in CCC studies, followed by a detailed description of the mechanisms of signal molecule transmission and the importance of the main signaling pathways they mediate in maintaining biological functions. Then we systematically introduce a series of human diseases caused by abnormalities in cell communication and their progress in clinical applications. Finally, we summarize various methods for monitoring cell interactions, including cell imaging, proximity-based chemical labeling, mechanical force analysis, downstream analysis strategies, and single-cell technologies. These methods aim to illustrate how biological functions depend on these interactions and the complexity of their regulatory signaling pathways to regulate crucial physiological processes, including tissue homeostasis, cell development, and immune responses in diseases. In addition, this review enhances our understanding of the biological processes that occur after cell–cell binding, highlighting its application in discovering new therapeutic targets and biomarkers related to precision medicine. This collective understanding provides a foundation for developing new targeted drugs and personalized treatments.},

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

We consider a new transportation distance ( i.e. that minimizes a total cost of transporting probability masses) that unveils the geometric nature of the structured objects space. Unlike Wasserstein or Gromov-Wasserstein metrics that focus solely and respectively on features (by considering a metric in the feature space) or structure (by seeing structure as a metric space), our new distance exploits jointly both information, and is consequently called Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW). After discussing its properties and computational aspects, we show results on a graph classification task, where our method outperforms both graph kernels and deep graph convolutional networks. Exploiting further on the metric properties of FGW, interesting geometric objects such as Fr\{é\}chet means or barycenters of graphs are illustrated and discussed in a clustering context.},

Applied to single‐cell data, such analyses provide mechanistic insights into individual cells and their interactions. However, knowledge of intercellular communication is scarce, scattered across resources, and not linked to intracellular processes. To address this gap, we combined over 100 resources covering interactions and roles of proteins in inter‐ and intracellular signaling, as well as transcriptional and post‐transcriptional regulation. We added protein complex information and annotations on function, localization, and role in diseases for each protein. The resource is available for human, and via homology translation for mouse and rat. The data are accessible via OmniPath’s web service (https://omnipathdb.org/), a Cytoscape plug‐in, and packages in R/Bioconductor and Python, providing access options for computational and experimental scientists. We created workflows with tutorials to facilitate the analysis of cell–cell interactions and affected downstream intracellular signaling processes. OmniPath provides a single access point to knowledge spanning intra‐ and intercellular processes for data analysis, as we demonstrate in applications studying SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and ulcerative colitis.},

  abstract = {Optimal transport theory has recently found many applications in machine learning thanks to its capacity to meaningfully compare various machine learning objects that are viewed as distributions. The Kantorovitch formulation, leading to the Wasserstein distance, focuses on the features of the elements of the objects, but treats them independently, whereas the Gromov–Wasserstein distance focuses on the relations between the elements, depicting the structure of the object, yet discarding its features. In this paper, we study the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance that extends the Wasserstein and Gromov–Wasserstein distances in order to encode simultaneously both the feature and structure information. We provide the mathematical framework for this distance in the continuous setting, prove its metric and interpolation properties, and provide a concentration result for the convergence of finite samples. We also illustrate and interpret its use in various applications, where structured objects are involved.},

To address this, we develop SIMO, a computational method designed for the Spatial Integration of Multi-Omics datasets through probabilistic alignment. Unlike previous tools, SIMO not only integrates spatial transcriptomics with single-cell RNA-seq but expands beyond, enabling integration across multiple single-cell modalities, such as chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation, which have not been co-profiled spatially before. We benchmark SIMO on simulated datasets, demonstrating its high accuracy and robustness. Further application on biological datasets reveals SIMO’s ability to detect topological patterns of cells and their regulatory modes across multiple omics layers. Through comprehensive analysis of real-world data, SIMO uncovers multimodal spatial heterogeneity, offering deeper insights into the spatial organization and regulation of biological molecules. These findings position SIMO as a powerful tool for advancing spatial biology by revealing previously inaccessible multimodal insights.},

Despite this progress, efforts to comprehensively benchmark different platforms are currently lacking. The extant variability across technologies and datasets poses challenges in formulating standardized evaluation metrics. In this study, we established a collection of reference tissues and regions characterized by well-defined histological architectures, and used them to generate data to compare 11 sST methods. We highlighted molecular diffusion as a variable parameter across different methods and tissues, significantly affecting the effective resolutions. Furthermore, we observed that spatial transcriptomic data demonstrate unique attributes beyond merely adding a spatial axis to single-cell data, including an enhanced ability to capture patterned rare cell states along with specific markers, albeit being influenced by multiple factors including sequencing depth and resolution. Our study assists biologists in sST platform selection, and helps foster a consensus on evaluation standards and establish a framework for future benchmarking efforts that can be used as a gold standard for the development and benchmarking of computational tools for spatial transcriptomic analysis.},
