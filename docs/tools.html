scores for any gene pair between two cell types. In parallel builds a gene network per cell type using principal component regression. To infer CCIs between two cell types, it uses the score matrix and the respective gene networks as inputs of two neural networks (one per cell type), which embed the genes per cell. Then an embedding alignment is performed, and used to determine significant LRIs.","Learns a cell type Bayesian network based on the cellular composition in each sample and computes a joint probability between cell types depending on their mixture per sample. Then a regression model is built based on the DE expression of ligands in sender cells to explain changes in their intracellular target genes in receiver cells. Both models are combined to infer changes of cell-cell communication across samples.","Performs a non-negative CP tensor decomposition on communication scores arranged as a 4D tensor. The dimensions of this tensor represent multiple contexts or samples, ligand-receptor interactions, sender cells, and receiver cells. The resulting factors capture context-driven patterns of cell-cell communication.","Performs a DE analysis and builds co-expression networks. Identifies cell-type-enriched ligands and receptors pairs to generate autocrine and paracrine interactions.","Uses a dimensionality reduction approach to find multicellular programs of gene expression. It relies on the method behind MOFA, based on a probabilistic group factor analysis. Then, it can associate specific factors of the latent space with cell-cell communication events, given that the relevant genes could be associated with ligands, receptors, and signaling genes.","Prioritizes ligand-receptor pairs that are strongly expressed in the condition of interest, are cell-type specific, are present in most samples of the condition of interest, and whose target genes are enriched in the receiver cell type. It relies on edgeR analysis to score ligand-receptor pairs from differential expression and ligand activity.","Designed for detecting CCIs in early embryo development. It computes a Spearman coefficient for LRIs between cell types along pseudotimes. Then, it computes a Granger's causality between the interaction score the co-varying LRI and the gene expression of their downstream master TFs.","Evaluates cell-cell communication chains, which corresponds to the effect that a receiver cell could have on a third cell. It uses CellA-CellB-CellC chain by weighting ligands from Cell A to receptors on Cell B, and ligand from Cell B to receptors on Cell C. Also evaluates the intracellular changes within Cell B connecting activity from Cell A to C. Identifies the differential activation of pathways between two conditions.","Computes a perturbation score between a test and a reference condition. This score is based on the logFC of the expression of the ligand and the receptor.","Uses a matrix factorization method to identify MultiCellular Programs (MCPs) across multiple niches within the same tissue, or across multiple samples from different individuals. A MCP is captured per factor, and they can be integrated with ligand-receptor interactions to summarize communication represented by each MCP.","Combines NicheNet with differential expression analysis between two conditions. This method returns a score that prioritizes up-regulation of the ligand and/or receptor in the condition of interest, expression level within the group, cell-type-specific expression, and high NicheNet score.","First queries a DB to evaluate plausible LRIs between a pair of cell types. Then, it uses the deconvolved gene-expression matrix obtained with CODEFACS to use cell-type resolution, and predicts enriched LRI in each condition with a Fisher's exact test.","Extracts “multicellular gene expression patterns” across different biological samples. It uses a Tucker tensor decomposition, generating factors that represent gene expression patterns. These patterns can be integrated with ligand-receptor interactions to summarize communication represented by each factor.","Models the distribution of the expression product of ligands and receptors and accounts for intersample variances and small sample sizes. It evaluate differential changes in the expression products between two conditions.","Builds a CCC network per dataset based on the expression of the ligands and the receptors in a cell-cell pair. Compares two conditions by a differential analysis of the resulting CCC from the network.","Uses multiplex networks to represent different ligand-receptor pairs between cell types. Performs comparative analysis between two conditions by computing a dissimilarity metric for each pair of networks representing the same ligand-receptor pair in each condition.","Identifies ligands and receptors in different cell types that follow coherent expression patterns along time. It uses a Continuous-state Hidden Markov Model (CSHMM), which is a probabilistic graphical model, to learn trajectories and to assign cells to specific points along the trajectories.","Infers CCIs in each condition separately, then performs a differential analysis on the resulting communication scores. scDiffCom builds a null distribution to select significant changes.","Compares multiple cell-cell communication across multiple scRNA-seq datasets by leveraging CellChat V1.","Identifies differentially expressed ligands and receptors using the software of interest to identify changes in CCC.","Generates CCC networks assigning edge weights to each ligand-receptor interaction between a sender-receiver cell pairs. Compares two conditions purely based on the differences between their CCC networks.","Evaluates the binary use of a ligand-receptor pair between sender and receiver cell types within a group of samples, then compares different groups to see shared and specific LR pairs per sender-receiver cell pair.","Computes a Spearman correlation between ligands (L), and receptors (R), and another between receptors and target genes (T). To compute significance, relies on a null distribution of Spearman coefficients generated from randomized expression datasets. Assuming that distributions of LR and RT are independent, joint significance is the multiplication of their individual significances.","Builds a ligand-receptor and ECM-receptor database using GO terms to filter known PPI databases. CCIs are inferred based on LR interactions expressed in cell types. To investigate condition-associated perturbations, DGE metrics based on the tool MAST are used (e.g., logFC and P-value).","Uses networks of ligand-receptor interactions connected to their TFs, and links the TFs with their target genes. CCCExplorer is based on differential expression of ligands and target genes (vs WT), while receptors and TFs are considered expressed if they are over a threshold.","Identifies multi-subunit ligand-receptor interactions at the cell type level by computing expression products of all possible combinations between ligand subunits and receptor subunits. It calculates average expressions of ligand and receptor subunits across cell clusters, and removes the LR pair if any subunit is not expressed in these averages. It then shuffles the cluster annotations and recalculates average expressions. If the product of the original clusters' average expressions significantly exceeds that of the shuffled clusters, the subunit interaction is deemed significant. DiSiR identifies an interaction as significant if all subunit combinations in the input list are significant.","Computes a communication score as the expression mean between the ligand and the receptor in a pair of cell types.","Selects differentially expressed genes per cluster, then computes communication scores using those genes as the expression product between the ligand and the receptor in a pair of cell types. Computes an overall CCI score as the sum of the communication scores.","Implements multiple communication scores, including a regularized product, weight product, mean, and product of gene expression between the ligand and the receptor in a pair of cell types. Uses target genes of the receptors to inspect intracellular signaling. For target genes, it uses differential expression analysis.","Computes a communication probability using the law of mass action (hill function). Prior to compute the probability, it performs an identification of over-expressed genes per cell group. CellChat can perform an aggregation of the probabilities for individual LR pairs into a pathway level. Also, it can detect patterns of communication either at the sender or receiver level.","Computes a communication score as the expression product between the ligand and the receptor in a pair of cell types. FlyPhoneDB uses the log1p transformed expression as input.","Computes a communication score as the expression product between the ligand and the receptor in a pair of cell types. Multimeric ligands or receptors are computed as the geometric mean of the expression across their components. An overall CCI score is computed as the sum of all communication scores.","Uses a regularized expression product as the communication score. The regularization factor scales each communication score in relation to the mean expression level of the data. Thus, communication scores are bound between 0 and 1.","Builds upon NicheNet to compute the regulatory potential between receptors and target genes, instead of ligands and target genes. By using a Personalized PageRank to compute that potential, it is able to detect responsive ligands and receptors, connected through the intracellular signaling information. Thus, LRLoop detects [L1–R1]<->[L2–R2] interactions where L1 and L2 are ligands that are among the target genes of R2 and R1 receptors, respectively.","Predicts communication scores by selecting the minimum expression between a ligand and a receptor. It incorporates intracellular signaling by assigning scores to receptor-TF associations using a Personalized PageRank algorithm. It also includes TF activity on the final score.","Connects two intracellular networks (from different cells) through known ligand-receptor interactions. It prioritizes LR pairs that are not used for autocrine interactions (low correlation within the same cluster) to assign a high crosstalk score. Then, it employs a network propagation based on the gene expression of intracellular genes. Finally it identifies signaling networks as a prize-collecting steiner forest problem to find intracellular genes that are close to highly-scored LR pairs.","Uses a network of ligand-receptor-TF-targets, and considers only pathways whose ligands and receptors are expressed. This means that they are over a z-value when comparing all clusters or cell types. It connects receptors to TF using Pearson correlation. It excludes receptors that are downstream to a TF in the network.","Binary presence of TFs by fraction of cells within a cluster. It uses a Markov Chain model to infer the probability of a receptor to induce present TFs, considering intermediate genes. Finally computes LR score as the product of the average expression of the ligand and the receptor in their respective populations (only applies for ligands and receptors selected in a CCI scaffold)","Builds a multilayer network of Ligand-Receptor pairs, Receptor-TF pathways, and TF-target genes. It uses the cell-type-specific highly-expressed genes to infer CCIs. LR pairs are scored with their expression product. It uses Fisher's exact test to consider active TFs, by using information of expressed target genes. Then LR pairs and enriched TFs are connected with another Fisher's test, considering whether active TFs are enriched in a given receptor. Thus, only LR pairs passing these test are retained.","Integrates multiple sources of information such as PPI networks and membrane-receptor regulatory networks. It relies on other tools to compute the receptor activity as a regulator of target genes. Finally, aggregates all the scores through a Robust Rank Aggregation method, generating a final rank of LR pairs.","Uses a Personalized PageRank algorithm to identify important ligands having an effect on downstream target genes. Its analysis incorporates gene expression of the ligand in the sender cells, and the target genes in the receiver cells.","Accounts for non-protein ligands by considering the gene expression of their last bona fide enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway. It computes a communication score as the mean of the ligand and receptor expressions. It builds upon previous versions of CellPhoneDB, so it also incorporates protein complexes and spatial location of cells.","Infers metabolite-mediated intercellular communication from the gene expression level of producing and consuming enzymes of the metabolite and the cognate receptor. The metabolite score is computed as the difference between the expression of the producing and consuming enzymes. This score is later used with the expression level of the receptor to compute a final communication score for the metabolite-receptor interaction.","Computes the geometric mean between the scores assigned to the ligand and the receptor in a LR interaction. Ligands can include small compounds, which incorporate the expression level of producing enzymes (geometric mean among all synthesis enzymes), vesicle transporters, and reuptake transporters.","Computes communication scores as the product of ligand and receptor-target abundances. Ligand abundances of metabolites are inferred from the gene expression of producing enzymes and transporters.","Computes a score for each LR pair based on their expression levels in each interacting cluster. It associates this score with target genes by computing a pathway activity score from a weighted protein-protein interaction network. This activity is computed from a gene set enrichment analysis on the regulons of a transcriptional regulator.","Integrates ligand-receptor-TF relationships as well as TF-Target Genes. It computes the interaction scores by weighing with the TF activity score. This TF activity comes from a gene set enrichment analysis using the coexpressed target genes of that TF (regulons).","Incorporates gene expression of genes that are downstream to a receptor in a ligand-receptor interaction. By using their expression levels, it can weigh a communication score accordingly resulting in a probability that a signal is sent by a given cell to another cell via a given pathway.","Infers the signaling activity in pathways encompassing external signals, receptors, TFs, and target genes. Thus, it infers the ligand-target GRN from their gene expression, and assigns a signaling strength using a mass-action-based score.","Integrates an embedded topic model and a variational autoencoder to infer cell-cell communication in a single-cell resolution. This approach projects single-cell data into a low-dimension topic space, based on natural language processing to find meaningful topics (here LR gene-driven patterns of CCIs).","Uses a deep generative model based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) to integrate spatial and single-cell transcriptomics to obtain inter-cellular colocalization networks. These networks allow to identify cell-cell interactions between colocalized single cells, relying on NicheNet method.","Computes communication scores as the geometric mean of ligand and receptor expression levels, using single cells as the senders and receivers.

When using spatial transcriptomics, it computes CCIs only of neighboring cells, defined with a distance threshold or with a k-nearest neighbor graph. Subsamples single cells when the cell number is too high.","Uses a multi-level graph autoencoder to infer CCIs. One graph considers cell-cell relationships to represent the proximity of cells and their potential to interact. The other graph considers gene-gene relationships to represent the intracellular activity and ligand-receptor interactions. Thus, the autoencoder model includes two encoders, one for each graph, to project the CCIs into a latent space that is able to reconstruct a physical adjacency matrix of cells.","Applies a collective optimal transport model to infer CCIs using spatial transcriptomics. This preserves the comparability between distributions (total signal does not exceed the individual species amounts - ligand or receptor - , and enforces spatial range limits and handles multiple competing species.","Uses spatial transcriptomics to weigh LR interactions based on intercellular distances. LR interactions are filtered out given a permutation analysis. This tool mainly focuses on the effect on target genes and tries to identify the important LR pairs contributing to those effects.","Uses an adaptive graph model to infer CCIs. By using a gene-based linear encoder and a cell-based attentive graph encoder, genes are projected into the latent space. The resulting embeddings reflect gene expression and spatial organization, which are then used to define triplets including interacting and non-interacting genes, helping to identify the use of given LR pairs.","Identifies LR pairs with significant spatial co-expression within a reasonable physical distance. For doing so, it uses a bi-variate Moran's correlation coefficient as a test statistic.

Finally, it uses a cross-entropy approach to obtain low dimensional embeddings of CCIs.","Uses a Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) approach to find latent topics of cells and genes. It applies a LDA to regular single-cell data and another to data coming from doublets (interacting cells). These two LDAs help to identify topics that are a consequence of the CCIs. Afterwards, topics are associated to cell types and genes, so specific molecular and cellular properties of CCIs can be interpreted.","Uses graph convolutional neural networks to infer gene interactions involved in cell-cell communication from spatial single-cell expression data. GCNG encodes the spatial information as a graph and combines it with expression data to infer extracellular gene-gene interactions.","Applies a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model using an expectation-maximization algorithm. It considers the expression of ligands and receptors in a cell, and the expression of ligands in its neighboring cells, as well their annotations to compute a conditional likelihood of CCI.","Uses an optimal transport model to compute a distance matrix for gene-gene dissimilarity and cell-cell dissimilarity given their spatial locations. Then, another optimal transport model is used based on the probability of cells for using ligand-receptor pairs. It employs distributions of the sources (ligands) and receivers (receptors and downstream genes) based on their cognate gene expressions. The distance matrix here is used as a cost matrix.","Models the variance across cells of the gene expression level due to the additive effect of an intrinsic effect due to the cell state, a cell-cell interaction effect due to the state of the neighboring cells, and an environmental effect due to unobserved factors in the cell microenvironment. Thus, it can decompose the gene expression into these three effects and potentially identify CCIs given the spatial organization of cells.","Uses a generalized linear regression model to infer CCIs from spatial transcriptomics. It models the CCI as an exponential decay depending on the intercellular distance, and includes the cellular composition or labeling of spots and single-cells, respectively. This model infers the overall potential of CCIs.","Evaluates the colocalization of cell types and their use of LR pairs in a spatial spot. By using a Fisher's exact test, identifies significant LR pairs in colocalized cell types within a spot. It relies on the expression product as the communication score, and considers those that are greater to zero. Finally, it runs CellChat and evaluates CCIs only on those that were significant from Fisher's exact test.","Uses a partial least square regression model to identify the CCI effects on multiple neighboring cell types. This model assumes that the expression of highly variable genes specific to a cell type are explained by a linear sum of the effects by neighboring cell types.","Builds multiple views focusing on different spatial or functional contexts to dissect different effects. Each view represents a potential source of variability in the measured marker expressions. The models for each view are trained independently, while the fusion parameters of the meta-model are estimated after training the view-specific models independently, by regularized linear regression.","Uses machine learning to infer physical cell-cell communications by identifying, annotating, and analyzing cell multiplets from the undissociated cell fractions in single-cell RNA-seq data.

Ligands are connected with their cognate receptors, and the edge weight is their correlation across all cell types. Then, it runs a community detection approach to identify conditionally dependent LR pairs. Conditionally independent LR pairs are removed through a GLasso algorithm. Finally, it creates interactomes between cell types by using only conditionally dependent LR pairs.","Simulates gene expression in two steps: (1) Employing a kinetic model to generate the true gene expression levels in cells, and (2) introducing technical variations (library preparation noise, batch effects, etc) to generate data that are statistically comparable to real data.

In parallel builds a gene network per cell type using principal component regression.
