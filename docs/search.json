    "text": "1.3 Methods\n\n1.3.1 Datasets\nPrior knowledge: Ligand-receptor and GRN databases\n\n\nNetworkCommons:\n\nPython GitHub repository\nProgrammatic access to multiple omics datasets\nNetwork inference tools, including CORNETTO\nBenchmarking configurations, and relevant associated metrics.\n\n\nThe LIANA framework developped by Dimitrov et al. (2022) not only compares the performance of CCC tools using a combination of consensual comparisons and comparison against ground truths, but also provides with an unified interface to multiple CCC databases Figure 1.2, paired with global overlap metrics across databases Table 1.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: The lineages of CCC interaction database knowledge. General biological knowledge databases are reported in blue, CCC-dedicated resources in magenta, and additional resources included in iTALK in cyan, from Dimitrov et al. (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.2: Available prior knowledge resources tested in benchmark Dimitrov et al. (2022) are largely composed of ligand-receptor, extracellular matrix, and adhesion interactions. Note that most of these resources, notably the curated ones, have been collectively collected in the OmniPathR database, from Türei et al. (2021).\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Hurdles for benchmarking cell-cell communication inference methods\nPartial overlap between CCC databases\nMetric quantifying spatial gene expression distribution.\n\n\nWasserstein distributions to compare probability distributions:\n\nRepresents the minimum total transport cost between two distributions.\nUse of Regularised versions, such as the Sinkhorn algorithm, for faster computation and reduces influence of extreme observations.\nDetailled theoretical explanations: (Rolet, Cuturi, and Peyré 2016; Huizing, Cantini, and Peyré 2022; Solomon 2017; Peyre, n.d.).\n\nConsider truly spatial distributions and statistics -&gt; the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance is a generalization of the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance that accounts for both feature (pointwise) and structural similarities (geometric) between two metric measure spaces. Enables to maintain the graph structure, as suggested in [Vayer et al. (2020);titouan2019p3icml].\n\n\nAnnotate cell-populations in spatial omics\nRecent deconvolution papers include:\n\nSTRIDE\n\nRelevant benchmark papers include:\n\n\nSystematic comparison of sequencing-based spatial transcriptomic methods, from You et al. (2024).\n\nA comprehensive benchmarking with practical guidelines for cellular deconvolution of spatial transcriptomics, from Haoyang Li et al. (2023).\n\nBenchmarking spatial and single-cell transcriptomics integration methods for transcript distribution prediction and cell type deconvolution, from B. Li et al. (2022). Conclusions from the paper are reported in Important 1.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant 1.1: Best spatial deconvolution algorithms\n\n\n\nFrom B. Li et al. (2022), Tangram, gimVI, and SpaGE outperformed other integration methods for predicting the spatial distribution of RNA transcripts, whereas Cell2location, SpatialDWLS, and RCTD are the top-performing methods for the cell type deconvolution of spots.\n\n\n\n\nBenchmark decision tree for Deconvolution Algorithms applied to Spatial Transcriptomics\n\nDynamic integration and mapping of cell populations\n\n\nSIMO, for Spatial Integration of Multi-Omics, from Yang et al. (2025).\n\nProbabilistic alignment relying on the fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport algorithm\nIntegrates multiple single-cell modalities, such as chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation.\nIntegrates co-localisation spatial patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor hurdles when performing cell type annotation with a dynamic dimension\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor challenge is to track invidual cells’s fate across time points, with both experimental variability (distinct technologies and experimental conditions across time points, image rotation and distortion, etc.) and biological variability (mutations in tumoral environment, cell differentiation in early-developmental stages, cell deaths, …).\n\n\n\nDiscriminate paracrine or juxtacrine with endocrine signalling (short vs long-range communications)\n\nDiscriminate between short- and long-range cell-cell communications:\n\n\nCurrent Use of \\(k\\)-means, to be replaced with:\n\nUse of mixture models to characterise and automatically retrive the threshold\nBanditPAM\nSelection of the number of clusters\nEven better, review latest spatial methods tailored to spatial clustering.\n\n\n\n\nCompare distances by:\n\n\nUse of Distance Enrichment Score (compare the distribution of predicted short-rank and long-rank interactions with what’s observed), similar to GSEA as showcased in (Subramanian et al. 2005), and theretically largely inspired from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test. - General advises for enhanced comparision of statistical distributions. Indeed, the KS only evaluates the maximal discrepancy between two distributions, and not the whole statistical distribution.\n\nConfusion matrix between predicted short-range and long-range communications, benchmarked against the consensual setting.\nSimulate in-silico spatial transcriptomic distributions\nSingle-cell simulations\n\n\nSplatter, from Zappia, Phipson, and Oshlack (2017).\n\nA two-stage simulation process: 1.Estimation of the parameters from realistic datasets.\n\nGeneration of a synthetic dataset from the prior parameters inferred in stage 1.\n\n\nAvalaible as a Bioconductor R package.\nSix simulation scenarios:\n\n\n“Simple”: Negative binomial distributions.\nExtension to model 1 by adding technical noise resulting from distinct depth sequencing (aka library size factor).\nAdds an additional batch effect to model 2.\nMixtures of potential distinct probability distributions.\nBASiCS: models both biological and technical variation evaluated through spike-ins genes\nSplat: Gamma (for mean gene expression)-Poisson (for cells counts) hierarchical model + inclusion of outliers + inclusion of drop-outs + library size + Biological Coefficient of Variation to enforce a mean-variance trend.\n\nDAGs of the hierarchical models used for simulation.\n\n\nTailored for modelling scRNASeq datasets only, no accounting for spatial dispersion.\n\n\n\nscDesign2:\n\nTailored towards single-cell modelling and simulations only.\nUses copulas, only modelling the marginal distirbution of gene expression. Report to Tip 1.1 for details.\nOnly avalaible as the Github R repository scDesign2 with following tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 1.1: Copula Decomposition of Multivariate Distributions: the Sklar’s Theorem\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering a multivariate probability distribution, characterised by random vector \\(\\mathbf{X} = (X_1, X_2, ..., X_d)\\) if dimension \\(d\\), the Sklar’s theorem, aka the copula decomposition, allows decomposing the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) into their marginals (no correlation between them by definition) and a function that describes the dependence structure (aka the covariance structure) between them. The copula is this coupling function, hence the name.\nIn details, for a d-dimensional random vector \\(\\mathbf{X} = (X_1, ..., X_d)\\) with joint CDF \\(F(x_1, ..., x_d)\\) and continuous marginal CDFs \\(F_1(x_1), \\ldots, F_d(x_d)\\), there exists a unique copula function \\(C\\) that allows decomposition of the joint probability density function (PDF) of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) into (see (Equation 1.1)):\n\\[\nf(x_1, ..., x_d) = \\overbrace{c(F_1(x_1), ..., F_d(x_d))}^{\\text{Copula characterising covariance structure}} \\overbrace{\\prod_{i=1}^{d} f_i(x_i)}^{\\text{Marginal density functions}}\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\nIf the marginal distributions are continuous, this decomposition is unique.\n\n\n\nSpatial simulations\n\n\nSpatialDE, from (Svensson, Teichmann, and Stegle 2018):\n\nModels interactions across gene expression profiles considering a multivariate Gaussian distribution, whose covariance term captures both spatial covariance and non spatial variance (assumption of IID noise).\nInspired from GP (Gaussian-Process) models, here tailored to spatial transcriptomic data.\nNot really tailored for simulating different kinds of spatial transcriptomc expression, model quite specific.\nImplemented in Python.\n\n\n\nspasim, from Feng et al. (2023).\n\nTailored for simulating spatial imaging rather than spatial omics distribution.\nRelevant enumeration of cell colocalisation spatial metrics in [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37822-0#Sec10]:\n\nAverage pairwise distance (APD)\nAverage minimum distance (AMD)\nCells in neighborhood (CIN)\nMixing score (MS) and Normalized mixing score (NMS)\nArea under the curve of the cross K function (AUC)\nCross K intersection (CKI)\nLocalized entropy, Saptial heterogeneity and entropy gradient.\nAverage nearest neighbor index (ANNI) to detect clusters of cell.\nImplemented as a BioConductor package apired with spaSim tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\nscMultiSim, from Hechen Li et al. (2023):\n\n\nCertainly, the most comprehensive simulation framework so far. Includes modelling of:\n\nDynamic variations (changes of GRNs across time points, aka RNA velocity + varying proportions of spliced and unspliced gene expression, in relation with chromatin accessibility quantified by scATACseq + cell line tree lineage).\nMulti-modal (gene expression, chromatin accessibility)\nAccounts for technical variations (library preparation noise including sequencing depth and cell-specific transcript capture + batch effet), inspired from SymSim (Zhang, Xu, and Yosef 2019) scRNASeq simulator.\n\n\nA BioConductor package, with its spatial transcriptomics tutorial. See Figure 1.3 below for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Overview of scMultiSim from Hechen Li et al. (2023). The minimal required input is a cell differential tree describing the differentiation relationship of cell types, and a user-input ground truth GRN. Optionally, a ground truth for cell-cell interaction and technical design.\n\n\n\n\nSRTsim, from Zhu, Shang, and Zhou (2023).\n\nAvalaible as a CRAN R package, a GitHub repository and a R Shiny App.\nTutorials are avalaible here, generated using pkgdown.\nThree-stage simulation protocol:\n\n\nStage 1: Define spatial coordinates for cell locations2. In details, it first uses a hull algorithm to define the outskirt of the tissue in the shape of a polygon. Secondly, within the polygon, you can either define a square grid within the polygon with the number of points determined by the user, mimmicking the process underlying 10X Visium generation, OR uses a random point process to create locations within the polygon using the sp::spsample R function3, looking alike MERFISH or seqFISH+ SRT technologies.\n\nStage 2, generate cell-specific expression counts: Four statistical generative models are avalaible, namely P for Poisson, NB for negative binomial, ZIP for zero-inflated Poisson; ZINB for zero-inflated negative binomial, the latter 2 accouting for model zero-inflation (the so-called drop-outs issue common in scRNASeq datasets). All measures are used to infer the expression model for each of the 4 statistical count models implemented, one gene after the other (strong assumption of gene independence and decorrelation with spatial location!!). The model finally selected is the one exhibiting the lowest AIC, whose parameters are subsequently used to generate synthetic expression counts.\n\nStep 3: assign the simulated counts to the locations in the synthetic data preserving the spatial expression pattern observed in the reference data4. Specifically, SRTsim assigns the simulated expression counts to locations in the synthetic data preserving the rank derived from real data (for instance, the spatial location associated with the highest expression of a given gene in the real data will match the spatial location assigned to synthetic data).\n\nOptionnal: Without prior knowledge, a reference-free simulation is also provided with the simulator, with the possibility of customising spatial patterns from a predefined shape of interest and generate synthetic data with user-specified model parameters.\n\nOptionnal 2: possibility to extrapolate existing domain areas to uncovered spatial areas using an affine transformation which preserves most of the topological features. Report to Figure 1.4 below for details.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput: a S4 object that contains:\n\nOne matrix with the spatial tissue coordinates\nThe corresponding simulated expression counts for all genes across all locations.\nThe estimated model parameters, the user-defined parameter inputs and the input random seed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Overview of SRTsim from Zhu, Shang, and Zhou (2023), Fig 1. Inputs for the reference-based approach include a gene expression count matrix, a location matrix, and an optional domain annotation matrix to depict tissue distributions.\n\n\nEvaluation against ground truth estimates\n\nCorrelation between CCC predictions and spatial adjacency\nRecovering the effect of receptor gene knockouts\nRobustness to subsampling\nAgreement with proteomics\nscRNA-Seq simulated datasets\nGround truth among methods.\n\n1.3.3 Computational platform and paper\n\nR or Python\nNextflow or Snakemake (if you start from raw datasets, or requires combining distinct script languages paired with slurm intensive use.)\nPackage structure, including ./vignettes folder, or simple call to Quarto or Jupyter Notebook documents.\nGithub or Gitlab repository, visibility? Contributions?\nChoice of the Journal:\n\nWhich review? Nature? Genome Biology?\nWhich tool for writing the paper? Overleaf? Shared GitHub repo? Use of Nature quarto extensions (Pro: generate automatically both html and pdf versions)\nWhich library repository (shared Zotero group has my favour)",
